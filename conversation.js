      "For a family kitchen that emphasizes a warm, wooden, and minimalistic design, I recommend considering soft, neutral colors to enhance the sense of space and light. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Soft Whites** - Crisp but not stark, creating a bright, clean look that pairs well with wood.\n2. **Warm Beiges** - Adds a touch of warmth and complements wooden textures beautifully without overpowering the minimalistic design.\n3. **Light Greys** - Offers a modern and subtle contrast to wood, supporting a minimalistic aesthetic without feeling cold.\n4. **Sage Greens** - Introduces a hint of color that's still soft and earthy, creating a cozy, inviting environment.\n5. **Pale Blues** - Reflects light beautifully and can make your kitchen feel more spacious, providing a calm and relaxing vibe.\n\nWould any of these options work for your vision?",

      "Combining three of the suggested colors can create a layered and harmonious look. A popular and aesthetically pleasing combination could be soft whites, light greys, and sage greens. Here’s how you might distribute them:\n\n- **Soft Whites**: Use this for the ceiling and possibly the upper cabinetry. It will help to brighten the space and make it feel larger.\n\n- **Light Greys**: This can be great for the main cabinetry or flooring. It's neutral and provides a subtle contrast with the soft whites.\n\n- **Sage Greens**: Ideal for a feature wall or as an accent color for the backsplash. It introduces a natural, earthy tone that complements the wooden textures and warm lighting, enhancing the cozy vibe.\n\nThis combination can keep the kitchen feeling open and airy while adding depth and interest with sage green. Would you like to explore this palette further, or do you have any adjustments in mind?",
